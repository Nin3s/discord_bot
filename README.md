# discord_bot
A bot in discord made with python. Not much to it, yet.

Right now it only does the basics listed in the discord.py documentation which can be found here:
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

The github for discord.py:
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

The code listed has the token removed.
