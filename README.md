# discord_bot
A bot in discord made with python. Not much to it, yet.

Right now it only does the basics listed in the discord.py documentation which can be found here:
https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

The github for discord.py:
https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py

The code listed has the token removed.

Update 5/21/2023: I have decided to convert all the python code into javascript. While python was much easier to work with, I wanted to learn js in a way that was fun for me.
